- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @krabby7

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Pikmin, Nintendo, Minecraft, Star Wars, ect. I am currently trying to make some Minecraft mods! While I have made some in the past with Mcreator I don't use it anymore.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m wanting to learn C# for overall game development however I have been learning Java in school!

- ðŸ“« Some of my accounts on other platforms are "krabby7_plays" for Curse Forge, "krabby7" for Xbox, "krabby7_playz" for Steam, and "Krabby7#6757" for discord. If you could not tell my Username is pretty much the same for everything.
