- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @krabby7
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Pikmin, Nintendo, Minecraft, Star Wars, ect. I recently have made some Minecraft mods (with the help of Mcreator) however I can say I do put effort into them.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m wanting to learn C# for overall game development however I also want to learn Java for making mods for Minecraft
- ðŸ“« Some of my accounts on other platforms are "krabby7_plays" for Curse Forge, "krabby7" for Xbox, "krabby7_playz" for Steam, and "Krabby7#6757" for discord. If you could not tell my Username is pretty much the same for everything.
